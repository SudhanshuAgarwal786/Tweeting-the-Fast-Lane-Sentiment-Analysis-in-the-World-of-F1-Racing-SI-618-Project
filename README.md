# Tweeting the Fast Lane: Sentiment Analysis in the World of F1 Racing SI 618 Project

I am a F1 enthusiast who follows F1 from the *lights out to the checkered flag*. The project involves the analysis of two publicly available datasets related to F1 Racing, encompassing Twitter data and comprehensive F1 race details. The project aims to perform EDA, create custom queries for establishing correlations between the datasets, and use NLP to delve into emotion analysis using the library NRClex. The primary project goals are to analyze sentiment in F1-related tweets and understand its relation with Formula 1 on-track results. This includes assessing emotion during races, determining their relationship with race results, and the effect of external factors. The study also delves into the influence of keywords and phrases, sentiment/emotion trends over time, and how sentiments/emotions change with driversâ€™ grid positions. Moreover, it aims to assess the effect of sentiment on the dynamics of F1 racing and its social media presence.
